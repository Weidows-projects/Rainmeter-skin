ABOUT

This is an addon for the Windows system monitoring application, Rainmeter (http://rainmeter.net). It sends a !WriteKeyValue bang command to Rainmeter, using a file or folder chosen by the user as the key's new value.

INSTRUCTIONS

RainFile.exe may be called with up to 7 parameters:

    "C:\...\RainFile.exe" "Type" "SectionName" "KeyName" "FileName" "DefaultValue" ["Pieces"] ["debug"]
	
    PARAMETER     KIND      DESCRIPTION                                                 VALUES ALLOWED
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Type          Required  The type of item to be selected by the user.                "File" or "Folder"
    SectionName   Required  The section modified by !WriteKeyValue.                     Any

                            folder is being chosen, the extension will be blank.
